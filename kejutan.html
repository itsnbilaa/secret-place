                Might not be forever, but if it's forever, it's even better
                And I don't know what I'm crying for

                Tell me it's a bit
                Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted
                Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid

                I don't think I could love you more
                Might not be long, but, baby, I don't wanna say goodbye

                lyrics: `So you're on the prowl wondering whether she left already or not
            Leather jacket, collar popped like Cantona
            Never knowing when to stop
            Sunglasses indoors, par for the course
            Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
            Cages and poles

            Call off the search for your soul, or put it on hold again
            She's having a sly indoor smoke
            And she calls the folks who run this her oldest friends
            Sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
            As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
            And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
            That you just swallowed have got you going

            [Chorus:]
            Come on, come on, come on
            Come on, come on, come on
            Number one party anthem

            She's a certified mind blower, knowing full well that I don't
            May suggest there's somewhere from which you might know her
            Just to get the ball to roll
            Drunken monologues, confused because
            It's not like I'm falling in love I just want you to do me no good
            And you look like you could

            [Chorus x2]

            The look of love - the rush of blood
            The "She's with me" - the Gallic shrug
            The shutterbugs - the Camera Plus
            The black and white - the colour dodge
            The good time girl - the cubicles
            The house of fun - the number one party anthem

            Come on, come on, come on
            Before the moment's gone
            Number one party anthem`,

            You should think about the consequence
            Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
            And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
            He's in the club doing, I don't know what
            You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)

            Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
            You've ruined my life by not being mine

            You're so gorgeous
            I can't say anything to your face
            'Cause look at your face (Gorgeous)

            At you for making me feel this way

            You're gorgeous

            You should take it as a compliment
            That I'm talking to everyone here but you (but you, but you)

            Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (dark room, dark room)
            If you got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
            But if you're single that's honestly worse
            'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts
            (Honey, it hurts)

            Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
            I feel like I might sink and drown and die

            You're so gorgeous
            I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
            'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
            And I'm so furious
            At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
            But what can I say?
            You're gorgeous

            You make me so happy it turns back to sad
            There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
            And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
            You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
            There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
            Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Yeugh), alone
            Unless, you wanna come along? (Oh)

            You're so gorgeous
            I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
            'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
            And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)
            At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
            But what can I say? (I say)
            You're gorgeous

            You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)

Yeah
Oh yeah

We're drivin' down the road

I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly makin' me want you

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake
I'm not usually this way
But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss
It's flawless
Really something
It's fearless

Oh yeah

Kau sanggup menghidupkan lagi
